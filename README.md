# Dual PT2399 Digi Delay

A delay module designed for the Loudest Warning 4U format


## Description

Built around two PT2399 delay chips.
Inspired equally by the Serge WAD and the Strega, it does clean pretty well but also pushes into the usual 2399 weirdness.

## Features

Dual PT2399 delays
Single input with gain control and mild overdrive when past about 1 o'clock
Switch to have delays in series or parallel
Delay goes from short as I think I could manage to well into clicks and squeals territory
CV control over delay time of each independently, with attenuverters
Join switch to have delay 1 CV/knob control affect delay 2 as well
Independent full wet outputs for each delay
Independent mix levels for each delay and dry into main mix out, with additional overdrive on the delays when pushed past about 1 o'clock
